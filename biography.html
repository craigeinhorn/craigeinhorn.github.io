Not all classically trained guitarists can pull this off. But Eugene's Einhorn has the touch. The Eugene Weekly, Eugene, OR

Craig Einhorn was born (1965) and raised in Yonkers, N.Y. He became enamored with the guitar at age twelve. In 1988 he earned a bachelor degree in Classical Guitar Performance from the State University of New York. In the same year he received a full scholarship to the Arizona State Graduate School of Music and completed his Masters in 1990.

In 1995 Craig released a CD entitled, "In With the Old, In With the New", which was used by Barbara Walters on national television. In 1996 Craig relocated to Eugene, Oregon and started teaching classical guitar for Lane Community College where he continues to teach.
