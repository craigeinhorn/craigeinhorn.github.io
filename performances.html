              <p>Computers, printers, and phones have taken over our lives. That's why it's so frustrating when they just won't work! Other tech support companies are expensive and leave their customers out of the loop by using obscure technical jargon. Here at Geek on a bike we don't just solve your problems. We take pride in our ability to explain technical issues using laymans terms so next time you can fix it yourself.</p>
              <p>Pricing: $20 per hour + $20 Transportation fee</p>

              <h3>SEO and SMM</h3>
              <p>A strong internet presence can be the best marketing strategy for your business.
                SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization and SMM stands for Social Media Marketing.
                If done properly, your business will be one of the first results to show up on a search page
                when people google a keyword that relates to your business. SMM means having a good social media
                presence, e.g. facebook, instagram, etc... When both of these strategies are utilized well
                they generate lots of new customers for your business.</p>
