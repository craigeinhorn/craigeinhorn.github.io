            Not all classically trained guitarists can pull this off. But Eugene's Einhorn has the touch. The Eugene Weekly, Eugene, OR

            Craig Einhorn was born (1965) and raised in Yonkers, N.Y. He became enamored with the guitar at age twelve. In 1988 he earned a bachelor degree in Classical Guitar Performance from the State University of New York. In the same year he received a full scholarship to the Arizona State Graduate School of Music and completed his Masters in 1990.

            In 1995 Craig released a CD entitled, "In With the Old, In With the New", which was used by Barbara Walters on national television. In 1996 Craig relocated to Eugene, Oregon and started teaching classical guitar for Lane Community College where he continues to teach.

            Craig performs throughout the United States. Appearances include the Honolulu Academy of Arts (HI), The Aloha Theater (HI), the Scottsdale Center for the Arts (AZ), The Filbert Festival (OR), the Art and the Vinyard Festival (OR), City of Yonkers Parks Concerts (NY), The World Beat Festival (OR), the Fiesta Latina (OR), and numerous other events. From 1999 to now Craig has been the featured soloist with the Lane Chamber Orchestra, the Port Angeles Symphony, The Salem Pops Orchestra, The Oregon Mozart Players, The Umpqua Chamber Orchestra, and the Oregon State University Chamber Orchestra.

            Also in 1999, Craig began an association with Mason Williams, composer and grammy winner for "Classical Gas". Mason and Craig have performed and recorded together and their collaboration continues.

            Craig's CD entitled "Obras", released in January of 2001 has had steady sales throughout the world since its release. In 2003 Craig released a live CD entitled, Live at the Old Siskiyou Barn.

            Craig also enjoys performing live on radio and television. Appearances include KWAX (with Caitriona Bolster), KRVM (with Mike Meyer) and KLCC (Fresh Tracks, with Liz Wise and Back Porch with Pete Lavelle), in Eugene, OR as well as Good Day Oregon; KPTV Portland. In May of 2004 Craig performed (and spoke in Spanish) on Mexican Radio station SQCS 98.1 for an audience of 100,000, broadcasted from Playa del Carmen, Mexico. In February of 2005 Craig released a CD of South American music entitled Choros, which has had steady international sales. In 2006 Craig released a CD of popular and original, Hawaiian influenced, songs entitled "Something Real". This release has exposed Craig's hidden talents as a song writer and singer.

            Craig has performed concerts for the following guitar societies: Jefferson Valley Guitar Society, the Buffalo Guitar Society, The Knoxville-Oak Ridge Guitar Society, and the East Florida Classical Guitar Society.

            Stylistic Description

            Craig Einhorn performs a wide variety of music from various time periods and countries. He also performs original instrumentals and songs. Included is his repertoire are works for solo classical guitar from Spain, Brazil, and Argentina as well as many other countries.

            In addition Craig performs works by Chet Atkins, Mason Williams (with whom he continues to collaborate) and original works, which represent an American example of solo guitar styles.

            In general Craig's concerts begin with more serious classical music and transition into more popular and Latin styles. During a tour of Hawaii in 2005, Craig was influenced by Hawaiian music. Craig often ends concerts by singing a few songs while accompanying himself on guitar or tenor uke. Einhorn concerts have been described as unpredictable and entertaining with an unmatched adeptness for variety while maintaining virtuosic musicianship. Craig also keeps a lighthearted atmosphere by telling short stories about his music and about performing experiences.

            Einhorn has been studying tango music and dancing since 2003. It is now common for tango dancers to perform for part of his concerts. It is also common for Craig to dance tango in his concerts accompanied by his own recordings.
